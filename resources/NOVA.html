  <ul>
  <li>When did you first use your powers?</li>
  <li>Who was the first person you accidentally hurt with your powers?</li>
  <li>Who, outside the team, helps you control your powers?</li>

  <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
  <p>We destroyed our surroundings in the fight. Where was it? What did we destroy?</p>

  <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
  <p>Your mind&rsquo;s eye opens, and you can see the world around you like never before. You can control it, at will, with ease. Of course, warping reality tends to have ramifications down the line, but in your moment of godhood...how could you possibly be worried?</p>

  <h2>BURN</h2>
  <p>@UUID[Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.basic-playbook-nova.Item.85dJPVC2vJl9GBTq]{Burn}</p>
  <p>When you charge up your powers, roll + conditions you currently have marked. On a hit, hold 3 burn. On a 7-9, mark a condition. On a miss, hold 2 burn and mark three conditions.</p>
  <p>Spend your burn on your flares. You lose all burn at the end of the scene.</p>

  <h2>PLAYING THE NOVA</h2>
  <p>Powerful, unrestrained, vulnerable, destructive. The Nova is power incarnate, capable of affecting the world and changing reality on a level their teammates can&rsquo;t possibly match&mdash;but that power comes with enormous risk, both to the Nova and to the world around them.</p>
  <p>The Nova&rsquo;s abilities are intentionally some of the most open-ended of any playbook. They can do nearly anything, though not without difficulty or cost. Chances are, if the Nova wants to do something with their superhuman abilities, there&rsquo;s a way they can twist their abilities to do that thing&mdash;after they unleash their powers, of course. And if they miss when unleashing their powers, the consequences will be much more severe than when the Beacon misses while firing a net arrow.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind the distinction between unleashing your powers and using your Burn and flares. To unleash, you push your powers to do something impressive right now. To use your Burn, you have to charge up, and then you can create all manner of cool effect through your flares, and you might not even need to roll. So if you just want a quick solution, you&rsquo;re probably unleashing. If you want to let loose with a string of effects, charge your flares.</p>
  <p>The Nova is particularly focused on each moment, each individual problem immediately at hand. They&rsquo;re so powerful, chances are good that they can at least try to overcome any obstacle with their powers, right then and there. As a result, this isn&rsquo;t a playbook for long-term planning or preparation. You&rsquo;re explosive, a battering ram of power. Don&rsquo;t be too afraid of conditions, because they feed right into your flares, giving you still more power to just make things happen, instantly. But that&rsquo;s your story&mdash;balancing the impossible, trying to keep a rein on your power and guide it in the right direction.</p>

  <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
  <p>When you charge up your powers, the burn you generate lasts until the end of the scene. To charge up your powers, tell the GM what you&rsquo;re actually doing, what that looks like for you. If, through charging up your powers, you wind up marking one condition too many, that still takes you out of the scene, just like normal. When you roll + conditions marked, add the total number of conditions you currently have marked to your roll&mdash;but keep in mind your bonus can&rsquo;t go higher than +4.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Reality storm</span>, if you cause unwanted collateral damage, the GM tells you what it is&mdash;and you can expect not to like it.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Constructs</span>, when you animate a construct independent of yourself, you can give it orders and have it take actions. It will obey you. For the most part, the GM tells you the results of anything it does, but the GM might have you make a move through your construct, if appropriate.</p>
  <p><span class="special">Shielding</span> allows you to protect someone in the moment, rolling + Freak to defend. It&rsquo;s transient and immediate.</p>
  <p><span class="special">Moat</span> allows you to set up a lasting defense in advance, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily help you right in the moment when your friend is in danger. <span class="special">Moat</span> lasts as long as you focus on it and spend more burn when it gets hit especially hard.</p>
  <p><span class="special">Worship</span> allows you to awe an audience in addition to whatever else you do when you unleash. You can <span class="special">unleash your powers</span> specifically to put on the display if you so choose.</p>
  <p><span class="special">Move</span> can refer to teleportation, barreling hard in one direction, or anything else that fits your powers.</p>
  <p><span class="special">Elemental awareness</span> lets you ask the GM any question you want, but it has to be about the place you&rsquo;re currently in, or elements in the area around you.</p>

  <h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="special">Thick and thin skinned</span>, from the Bull playbook. Take this if you want to be able to dish it out to the enemies that tick you off&mdash;especially seeing as your Burn only gets more effective if you&rsquo;re Angry all the time.</li>
  <li><span class="special">Fight the good fight</span>, from the Legacy playbook. Take this if you want to emphasize how strong you are by showing those times that you hold back and don&rsquo;t use your full strength.</li>
  <li><span class="special">Coming for you</span>, from the Transformed playbook. Take this if you want to alleviate some of the cost of marking the conditions you need in order to use your Burn.</li>
