      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <p>You don’t have any powers of your own, besides your incredible intellect. All of your amazing abilities come from inventions that you have created. You’re best known for one particular invention that you use regularly; choose one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prosthetic self-altering limbs</li>
        <li>power armor or cyborg body</li>
        <li>size-change device</li>
        <li>robotic sidekick</li>
        <li>force field belt</li>
        <li>hi-tech vehicle</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Labels</h2>
      <p><i>(at character creation, add +1 wherever you choose)</i></p>
      <p><b>DANGER:</b> 0</p>
      <p><b>FREAK:</b> 0</h4>
      <P><b>SAVIOR:</b> +1</P>
      <p><b>SUPERIOR:</b> +2</p>
      <p><b>MUNDANE:</b> -1</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How did you first reveal your genius to your friends or family?</li>
        <li>Why did you decide to use your intellect for the benefit of others?</li>
        <li>What accident or misfire taught you some sense of humility or responsibility?</li>
        <li>Who helped you realize you need other people?</li>
        <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you’ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.
      </p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
      <p>I created something lasting and beneficial for the whole team. What was it?</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <p>You told ____________________ about your shame and asked them for their confidence.</p>
      <p>You wish you could be a better hero, more like _____________________.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Influence</h2>
      <p>You need these people as much as they need you. Give Influence to two of your teammates.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
      <p>Sooner or later, all the super powers, elite training, and experience are helpless in the face of evil or disaster. That’s when somebody like you, gifted as you are with a peerless intellect, can rise to the occasion. Your plan, your invention, or your lightning-fast thought processes save the day, in a way no one else could have foreseen. Of course, after you’ve shown how different you are from them, that distance between you and the others is now that much greater. And the world is only going to pull you farther apart...</p>

      <h2>Your Shame</h2>
      <p>You have a deep and abiding sense of guilt for something you have created or had a hand in creating. It could have been something you invented when you first came into your genius, or something you set into motion that you no longer have the power to stop. It may even be something beyond your ability to achieve again, this once-in-a-lifetime creation. Just as you are a world-class intellect, your shame is a world-class problem. Whatever the case may be, your role in its creation is not publicly known...yet.</p>
      <p><b>What is your shame?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A prototype AI</li>
        <li>A cosmic phenomenon</li>
        <li>A catastrophic weapon</li>
        <li>A dangerous chemical</li>
        <li>A living monstrosity</li>
        <li>An altered former ally</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Whenever you are confronted with your shame</b>, either mark a condition or shift Superior down and Danger up. If your shame is an NPC, they can never lose Influence over you.</p>
      <p><b>At the end of every session</b>, answer the question: Did you take steps to make amends for your shame?</p>
      <p>If the answer is yes, mark potential. If the answer is no, give Influence to one of your teammates.</p>

      <h2>PLAYING THE BRAIN</h2>
      <p>Brilliant, guilty, impulsive, obsessed. The Brain is a once-in-an-era kind of mind, and they know it. They have the potential to completely change the world. It’s a terrible burden and an invigorating hope.</p>
      <p>Maybe once upon a time, the Brain could invent, create, and remake the world without thinking of the consequences or costs. But now the Brain is aware of both their responsibility to better the world, and the potential risks of their inventions gone awry. Play with these three poles of the Brain—the wanton inventor, the burdened world-fixer, and the guilty creator.</p>
      <p>You may think you should automatically be going after your Shame, but every time you are confronted with it, you are likely to suffer. Don’t worry that it won’t come into play if you avoid it—you can rest assured that your GM won’t miss out on an opportunity to bring your Shame to bear.</p>
      <p>With that said, you should definitely try to solve every single other problem you can get your hands on. You’re a genius, after all! The Brain is expected to butt into other people’s problems. You don’t want to become obnoxious to your fellow players, but trying to intervene in your teammates’ affairs on their behalf will draw attention to their story, while also giving them ample opportunity to tell you off and adjust your Labels.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Brain’s abilities work a bit similarly to the Nova’s in general concept—your brilliance is such that you can normally bend it to solve any given super-problem with gadgetry and invention. That said, keep in mind that your body is not particularly powerful, and with all your gadgets stripped away, you’re largely at the mercy of more physically powerful enemies.</p>

      <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
      <p>For <span class="special">Above the fray</span>, none of those triggers work if you are the leader.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Mission debrief</span>, deciding when you are “debriefing” is down to you and your group. If someone is telling you how you could’ve done better in a fight, then you’re probably in a debrief.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Logical angle</span>, “rationally pointing out their mistakes so they can do better next time” means that, from your perspective, you are genuinely trying to help. If they don’t like your help, they can just refuse to open up to you.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Scientific insight</span>, you may invent a crazy name for your scientific discipline if you so choose. If you don’t take this move, that doesn’t mean you are not a genius—it just means you don’t have mastery over a specific field.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Always prepared</span>, you can only restock when you would reasonably have access to supplies and equipment. It doesn’t have to be access to your own personal workshop, but it has to have supplies and parts that you can use, at minimum. When you restock, you only hold up to 2-gadgets—so if you already have 2-gadgets, you don’t get any more. Also, you can only spend 1-gadget when you introduce a new gadget—not when you reuse one you’ve already introduced. You should constantly be inventing new gadgets.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Tactical genius</span>, the “obvious flaw” can be something you, the player, make up in that moment. It’s only “obvious” to the genius mind of the Brain... and on a miss, it was never a true flaw at all.</p>
