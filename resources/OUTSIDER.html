  <h1>THE OUTSIDER</h1>
  <p>You&rsquo;re not from here. Your home is an amazing place, full of beauty and wonder. But there&rsquo;s something to them, something special that you&rsquo;re missing back home. Something...human. So yeah, you&rsquo;ll be hanging around. At least for now.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="rules">
  <div>
  <h2>Look</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>ambiguous, man, shifting, transgressing, woman</li>
  <li>strange body, animalistic body, neon body, human body</li>
  <li>glowing eyes, animalistic eyes, metallic eyes, bizarre eyes</li>
  <li>flashy clothing, mismatched clothing, average clothing, no human clothing</li>
  <li>your people&rsquo;s uniform, your station&rsquo;s costume, practical costume, humanizing costume, no costume</li>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>
  <p>You can fly, and you&rsquo;re pretty tough. Choose any two of the following:</p>

  <li>density control</li>
  <li>heliokinesis</li>
  <li>stunning beauty or pheromones</li>
  <li>radical shapeshifting</li>
  <li>alien weaponry</li>
  <li>telepathy and mind blasts</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Labels</h2>
  <p><em>(at character creation, add +1 wherever you choose)</em></p>
  <p><strong>DANGER:</strong> -1</p>
  <p><strong>FREAK:</strong> +1</p>
  <p><strong>SAVIOR:</strong> 0</p>
  <p><strong>SUPERIOR:</strong> +2</p>
  <p><strong>MUNDANE:</strong> 0</p>
  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Where do you come from?</li>
  <li>Why did you come to Earth?</li>
  <li>Why do you want to stay here (for now at least)?</li>
  <li>Why do your people want you to come home?</li>
  <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.</p>
  <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t trust each other at first, but that changed. How? Why?</p>
  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve been learning about Earth by spending time with _____________.</p>
  <p>You have a crush on ________________ but you keep it under wraps.</p>
  <h2>Influence</h2>
  <p>Choose your demeanor: haughty or cheerful.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re haughty, you think you&rsquo;re better than them. Give no one Influence.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re cheerful, you&rsquo;re thrilled to be here. Give everyone Influence over you.</p>
  <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
  <p>You embrace your home and call them for aid. They will answer your call&mdash;in force!&mdash;arriving exactly when you need them to turn the tide. They fight and serve you for the rest of the battle. Of course, when all is said and done...they&rsquo;d probably like to take you home with them. You did, after all, just prove yourself worthy.</p>

  <h2>PLAYING THE OUTSIDER</h2>
  <p>Strange, curious, na&iuml;ve, arrogant. The Outsider isn&rsquo;t from here, but that won&rsquo;t stop them from creating a life for themself right here on this planet. At least, for now. But can they find a place here? Will they even want to, once they get to know this world more? Or will they answer that siren call, and go home?</p>
  <p>When you make an Outsider, feel free to go nuts with your homeland. You might be an alien, absolutely, but you might also be from a parallel world, or from the future, or from a digital realm&mdash;whatever. The key is, wherever you&rsquo;re from, it has to be substantially different from Earth and Halcyon City, to the point that you don&rsquo;t fit in even when you try.</p>
  <p>A crucial thing to remember while playing the Outsider is that you aren&rsquo;t incompetent&mdash;you understand more than enough to get by in your new home. What you don&rsquo;t understand are the more complicated elements of the world around you.</p>
  <p>Pick a few key areas of different philosophy and psychology as you play your Outsider. You can add all the weird pieces you want&mdash;&ldquo;My people never let their feet touch the ground, and we can&rsquo;t see the color green, and we hear emotions!&rdquo;&mdash;but focus on important and difficult questions, like your people actively dismissing the idea of incarcerating criminals instead of reforming them or believing that those with great power are required to follow the will of the people.</p>

  <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
  <p><span class="special">Belong in two worlds</span> inherently implies that you have some status and power with your people. You also must have some method of contacting your people, whatever that might be for you.</p>
  <p>The hold you spend on pieces of tech or answers can represent benefits you&rsquo;ve gained over the course of your communication with your people, allowing you to say after the fact that they gave you technology or information during the conversation. Spending a hold to clear a condition through contact with home, however, is only appropriate when you&rsquo;re actually in contact with home.</p>
  <p>When you create a device with <span class="special">Alien tech</span>, you still need human technology to build on. While whatever you build can do something impossible, it often does a limited version of it&mdash;choosing on a 10+ that the device works exceptionally well ensures that you get everything you wanted, and maybe more.</p>
  <p>If you take a <span class="special">Kirby-craft</span>, its particulars are largely down to your fictional set up. How big is it? As big as you think makes sense. What does it look like? Whatever makes sense for your people&rsquo;s technology. Its strengths and weaknesses just tell you and the GM the important pieces about what the ship can do and how it can be damaged. If it gets damaged, you have to repair it to use it again.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Alien ways</span>, what counts as an important Earth custom is ultimately up to you and the GM. As a guideline, a custom is important when undermining it has consequences and/or creates friction with those around you. If nobody cares if you undermine that custom, it&rsquo;s probably not all that important.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Not so different after all</span>, remember that you have to actually do whatever options you choose. Make sure you let the other players know how you confess a flaw of your home, mislead them about your home, or describe the glories of your home during the conversation.</p>

  <h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="special">I am what you see</span>, from the Janus playbook. Take this if you want to put your Outsider&rsquo;s identity even more into the hands of others, and if you want to have lots of conversations about who you truly are.</li>
  <li><span class="special">C&rsquo;mon, Lucky</span>, from the Beacon playbook. Take this if you want to have an alien animal sidekick!</li>
  <li><span class="special">Symbol of authority</span>, from the Legacy playbook. Take this if you want to have a way to use whatever authority you hold from your home on a more regular basis.</li>
  </ul>
