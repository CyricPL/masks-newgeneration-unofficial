      <p>You’re young, but you’ve been around for a few years before switching teams. You know how to fight, but you’re known for one ability more than any other. Choose one.</p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Who mentored you in supervillainy?</li>
        <li>Who first showed you that you could do good?</li>
        <li>What was your goal as a villain?</li>
        <li>What caused you to switch sides?</li>
        <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you’ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.
      </p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
      <p>We fought a terrible enemy from my old life. Who was it and what did they take from me?</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <p>I’ve earned the trust of _________________, and I follow their example of what a hero should be.</p>
      <p>I did something terrible to __________________ once. I hope they can forgive me one day.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Influence</h2>
      <p>Do you talk openly about your days as a villain? If so, give each team member Influence over you. If not, just give Influence to the one teammate whose example you most closely follow.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
      <p>You’ve seen your greatest mistakes, and the rest of the world has, too. They’re all watching you now, judging every move you make. When everything is on the line and your back is against the wall, though, you’ll show them what you’re made of—that being a hero is a choice. An act of will. And you’ve got what it takes to save the day. Of course, afterward, you can expect both sides, hero and villain, to deeply question where your loyalties truly lie...</p>

      <h2>Friends in Low Places</h2>
      <p>You have ties to villains from your previous career. Choose three names to fill in:</p>
      <p>Finch, Ellen “Devil” Drummond, Mr. Cane, The Mad Magpie, Dr. Cutler, Armorer, Tegan Queen, Lovelace</p>
      <p>For each of them, choose a specialty.</p>
      <p>_______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info Obligation: ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏</p>
      <p>_______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info Obligation: ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏</p>
      <p>_______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info Obligation: ❏ ❏ ❏ ❏</p>
      <p>When you create your character, mark two obligations on one villain, and mark one obligation on another.</p>
      <p>When you come to them for help with your problems, mark obligation on them and they’ll help out within their specialty. If all their boxes are full, then they won’t help you until you help them.</p>
      <p>When time passes, roll + your highest obligation. On a 10+, they come crashing into your life with a crisis. On a 7-9, they call for a favor. On a miss, they don’t come knocking yet, but mark obligation with them—the debts are getting heavier.</p>
      <p>When you help one of these villains with their problems, erase two obligations on them.</p>

      <h2>PLAYING THE REFORMED</h2>
      <p>Haunted, redemptive, dangerous, tarnished. The Reformed is still young, but even in their short time they’ve done things—if not quite unforgivable, then pushing the limits. They filled the role of the villain, and they did it willingly and knowingly. And now they’re trying to do better, to be better, but redemption doesn’t come that easily.</p>
      <p>The key to playing the Reformed is to keep in mind that you’ve already been there. You’ve already walked on the dark side. You’ve already done bad things. Not just silly little pranks or tricks, the way the Delinquent might have. You were a villain. And you specifically chose to abandon that life to be better. So while you may be drawn to take criminal action, you’re also trying not to. You’re fighting your base impulses. Your bad habits. Maybe even your addictions.</p>
      <p>That said, your old life wasn’t all bad. Yeah, you aren’t going to rob banks or hurt people anymore, but you made friends. You developed relationships. And you got to know those people the other heroes are all too likely to just dismiss as “villains.” It’s not so easy to just cut all those people and relationships out of your life, especially when they’re trying to pull you back in. Don’t hesitate to go to those characters outlined in your <b>Friends in Low Places</b> for help, even if you are trying to be as noble as possible. Those people have some hold on you, but also you have relationships with them.</p>
      <p>Finally, embrace the conflict likely to come from your teammates mistrusting you, or the world mistrusting you. Don’t play the Reformed if you want to be assured that others are going to see you as heroic. Your teammates and the world at large are all likely to come at you harder than they might for any other character, but that’s what you signed up for.</p>

      <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For <span class="special">What the hell</span>, hero, you get to determine the nature of the injustice you call out. It shouldn’t be just a small perceived slight—the point of the move is to let you accuse more heroic types of wrongdoing, forcing them to perk up and listen because it’s a former villain doing it. They don’t have to agree with you that they committed an injustice, nor does anyone else, when you trigger the move. For ”You win over an onlooker,” at the GM’s discretion this can be interpreted as a crowd of individuals.</li>
        <li>For <span class="special">Dark past</span>, triggering the move allows you to fill in pieces of your past. Don’t confess to crimes that it would make absolutely no sense for you to have done— your confession has to be real and true to trigger the move. It also has to be a serious crime. No misdemeanors or small transgressions. Whatever you confess has to have hurt someone in some way.</li>
        <li>For <span class="special">Blowing off steam</span>, the GM is the final arbiter of whether or not the crime actually qualifies for the trigger. As long as you’re doing something illegal, something that you shouldn’t be doing, but that doesn’t directly, obviously, or significantly harm anyone, the move should trigger.</li>
        <li><span class="special">Do me a favor</span> gives you the ability to go to civilian contacts for help. The Reformed is plugged into criminals and villains, and this move may help you ask for favors from those networks. It also allows you to ask for help from people you’ve met in the civilian world.</li>
      </ul>
