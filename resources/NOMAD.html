      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <p>You’ve seen space, time, and everything in between. One might say you’ve seen it all. Besides your tremendous knowledge, experience, and haphazard on-the-job training, you picked up some neat toys on your travels. Pick two of your most important.</p>

      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Who took you from the Earth when you were younger?</li>
        <li>What farscapes did you explore?</li>
        <li>Who was your favorite traveling companion?</li>
        <li>What brought you back to stay (for now)?</li>
        <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you’ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.
      </p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
      <p>We had to deal with a danger I’d met while traveling the farscapes. What was it, and how did we send it away?</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <p>__________________ knows plenty that I don’t about this world, its people, and how to deal with them; I should follow their lead while I’m here.</p>
      <p>__________________ is...well...boring. But that’s okay! I’m going to make them more interesting.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Influence</h2>
      <p>You’re here, but not, and it’s going to take some time before you really commit. Give no one Influence over you.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
      <p>You basically exist with one foot out the door, ready to leave this place, to go back out into the wide expanse of the universe. You’ve never fully committed. That is, until today. Until right now. Now, you pour everything you have and everything you are into this moment. You pull off tricks no one from this planet has ever seen before. You use your tools in ways no one here could have ever imagined. You devote yourself, here and now, to a cause, and you achieve your goal in ways that you never could’ve if you’d only stayed home. Of course, now you’ve proved to everyone that you really don’t belong here, and the very skills that let you succeed are the ones you earned from out there...</p>

      <h2>PLAYING THE NOMAD</h2>
      <p>Weird, playful, mischievous, lonely. The Nomad has seen things that their peers can’t even imagine. They’ve seen the universe at play. They’ve encountered other cultures and ideas, and they have their own collection of cool toys. And for all that awesomeness, the Nomad has never had their own home or family. Their story is all about connecting deeply to the people and world around them, instead of bouncing off to something new and different.</p>
      <p>The two crucial questions for the Nomad during character creation are “What brought you back to stay (for now)?” and “Why do you care about the team?” The Nomad only works because they have chosen to remain with the team—if they followed their wanderlust, they wouldn’t be part of a <b>MASKS</b> game.</p>
      <p>Make sure that between these two questions, your Nomad has clear, durable reasons to stick with the team. “I came back to stay because I need to get a flux capacitor to repay my debt to the Pirate Queen of Orion” is a cool answer, but not a durable answer—as soon as the Nomad gets the flux capacitor, they can go back to space. “I came back to stay because I’m wanted across space for a crime I didn’t commit” is better—as long as you remain wanted, you’re stuck on Earth, and there’s no clear path to having that status changed.</p>
      <p>Finally, your extra, <span class="special">Putting down roots</span>, has you uniquely playing with Influence. You are incentivized to give out Influence, for all the benefits you get—but remember, you can only give out Influence to six characters total, including teammates. Some of the benefits are much more advantageous when you give Influence to an enemy than when you give it to an ally, too. And while you can take back Influence at the end of every session, it’s otherwise pretty hard to shift it around once you’ve given it out. Balancing the tension between wanting to give out your Influence and picking exactly the right people to give it to is at the heart of the whole playbook—so have fun with it!</p>

    <div>
      <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
      <p>For <span class="special">Out of this world</span>, what it means to plug into the cosmic aether is up to you. Maybe you listen to some weird music you picked up out in space; maybe you burn some transdimensional incense and meditate. Whatever you choose, it should be consistent—it shouldn’t shift every time you do it.</p>
      <p>For <span class="special">Putting down roots</span>, all rules not called out as different here function as normal. For example, those you give Influence to can still shift your Labels, and you can still reject their Influence. Your benefits are based on how many other characters have Influence over you—meaning that if you take Influence over you away from other characters, you may lose some of those benefits.</p>
      <p>Note that you do not have an advancement to retire or become a paragon; instead, you depart for reaches unknown, never to return. If you wish to retire or become a paragon, you must change playbooks first and become someone more settled, and less nomadic.</p>
