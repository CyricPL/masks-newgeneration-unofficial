  <h1>THE JANUS</h1>
  <p>Wake up. Breakfast. School. Work. Homework. Sleep. Repeat. It burns you up, being stuck in this life, unable to make a real difference. That is...until you put on the mask. And then, you can be someone else: a hero.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="rules">
  <div>
  <h2>Look</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>ambiguous, man, shifting, transgressing, woman</li>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>rodent/insect control</li>
  <li>bone generation, venom, or webs</li>
  <li>energy absorption</li>
  <li>supernatural senses</li>
  <li>impossible mobility</li>
  <li>substance mimicry</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Labels</h2>
  <p><em>(at character creation, add +1 wherever you choose)</em></p>
  <p><strong>DANGER:</strong> 0</p>
  <p><strong>FREAK:</strong> -1</p>
  <p><strong>SAVIOR:</strong> 0</p>
  <p><strong>SUPERIOR:</strong> 0</p>
  <p><strong>MUNDANE:</strong> +1</p>
  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>When did you first put on the mask? Why?</li>
  <li>Why do you keep a secret identity?</li>
  <li>Who, outside of the team, knows about your dual identity?</li>
  <li>Who thinks the worst of your masked identity?</li>
  <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.</p>
  <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
  <p>We saved the life of someone important, either to the city or to us. Who was it? Why are they important?</p>
  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>_____________________ knew you from your civilian life first.</p>
  <p>You refused to tell ___________________ your secret identity when they asked.</p>
  <h2>Influence</h2>
  <p>You look up to your teammates; they seem to have this superhero thing figured out. Give two of them Influence over you.</p>
  <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
  <p>The mask is a lie, and some piece of you has always known that. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if others can see it. You&rsquo;re the one that can do the impossible. Mask off. Costume on. And you&rsquo;re going to save the damn day. Of course, you better hope nobody nasty is watching...</p>

  <h2>Secret Identity</h2>
  <p>Your mundane life comes with a series of obligations. Choose a total of three obligations.</p>
  <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Barista, intern, host/ess, salesperson, delivery person, fast-food worker, babysitter, dishwasher, tech support, waitress/er</p>
  <p><strong>School:</strong> Schoolwork, athletic team, chess club, photography club, student government</p>
  <p><strong>Home:</strong> Caring for someone, household chores, paying bills, surrogate parenting</p>
  <p><strong>Social:</strong> Significant other, best friend, popularity, close relative, coach/teacher</p>
  <p>When time passes, roll + your Mundane to see how you&rsquo;re managing your obligations. On a hit, things are going pretty well&mdash;you have an opportunity or advantage thanks to one of your obligations. On a 7-9, you&rsquo;ve lapsed on one obligation, your choice. On a miss, you haven&rsquo;t given your normal life anywhere near the attention it deserves; the GM chooses two obligations that are going to bite you in the butt.</p>

  <h2>PLAYING THE JANUS</h2>
  <p>Stressed, responsible, dual, heroic. The Janus is two people in one, and their struggle is about balancing that paradox.</p>
  <p>You have your regular life and all its responsibilities on one side, and your superheroic life and all its madness on the other. And ultimately, you don&rsquo;t want to give up either one&mdash;but they both pull and pull at you, building up the tension until you feel like you&rsquo;re going to snap. That&rsquo;s okay, though. Your story&rsquo;s all about that tension, and overcoming it, especially thanks to the people around you. Cultivate relationships with NPCs and PCs&mdash;they&rsquo;re all important to your overarching story.</p>
  <p>Pay close attention to your mask. When do you wear it and when do you take it off? Who knows about your secret identity and who doesn&rsquo;t? For you, more than any other playbook, it matters which overt guise you&rsquo;re in, which mask you&rsquo;re wearing, and which face you&rsquo;re presenting to the outside world.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
  <p>For <span class="special">The Mask</span>, affirming your secret or masked identity means doing something that firmly plants you in that role. Leaving your teammates to go save your sister might affirm you as your secret identity, even while you&rsquo;re still wearing your mask. Doing the opposite, going off to fight the Blue Hydra instead of rescuing your sister from the Centipede, might affirm you in your masked role. Affirming your identity should always be a meaningful choice or action in the fiction, something with ramifications&mdash;good or bad&mdash; moving forward.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Game face, whether or not you made progress towards your goal is ultimately down to the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</span></p>
  <p>For <span class="special">I am what you see</span>, you can still reject the Label they try to impose on you&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll probably have to if you don&rsquo;t accept it.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Mild-mannered</span>, if they buy your facade you&rsquo;re in no immediate danger of being found out. If you&rsquo;re still under observation, it means that if you do anything too problematic, you&rsquo;re likely to get into trouble&mdash;they&rsquo;re watching you. If you leave something incriminating, it means that later you can expect someone to put two and two together and come to find you. If you have to make a fool of yourself, you can expect NPCs to use their Influence to affect how you see yourself&mdash;and probably inflict a condition.</p>
  <p><span class="special">I&rsquo;ll save you</span> is ultimately a move for making sure the people from your civilian life are safe at critical moments&mdash;though it may come at some cost to you. It has other applications, but if you want to be confident in your ability to save loved ones, this is the move for you.</p>
  <p>For <span class="special">Dangerous web</span>, you don&rsquo;t actually have to have put the trap in earlier&mdash; when you trigger the move, it can be the first time that you&rsquo;ve mentioned setting the trap. It has to fit the fiction&mdash;if there&rsquo;s no way you possibly could have left a trap, then you can&rsquo;t trigger the move. Talk out with the GM how and when you left the trap.</p>
  <p>For your <span class="special">Secret Identity</span>, the GM tells you what opportunity or advantage you receive on a hit. When you lapse on an obligation, that means you can expect to get trouble from it in the near future. When your obligations come back to bite you in the butt, they&rsquo;ll make your life more complicated almost immediately.</p>

  <h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="special">Straight. Up. Creepin&rsquo;.</span>, from the Beacon playbook. Take this if you want to do more &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; action while in your mundane mode&mdash;this move will help you to investigate dastardly deeds without your mask.</li>
  <li><span class="special">Are you watching closely?</span>, from the Delinquent playbook. Take this if you want more ways to play tricks on foes, and especially if your Mask Label is Superior.</li>
  <li><span class="special">I know what I am</span>, from the Legacy playbook. Take this if you want a stronger way to self-determine your character&rsquo;s identity, and especially if your Mask Label is Savior.</li>
