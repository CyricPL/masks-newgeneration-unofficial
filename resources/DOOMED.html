  <h1>THE DOOMED</h1>
  <p>Something about your powers dooms you. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before your doom comes for you. Until then, though...you&rsquo;ve got a nemesis who needs fighting and a world that needs saving. After all, it&rsquo;s better to burn out than fade away...</p>

  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>When did you first learn of your doom?</li>
  <li>Where did you get your sanctuary?</li>
  <li>Why do you oppose your nemesis?</li>
  <li>Who, outside of the team, is crucial to defeating your nemesis?</li>
  <li>Why does the team matter to you?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.</p>
  <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
  <p>We paid a high cost for victory. What was it?</p>
  <h2>Relationships</h2>
  <p>You told _______________ all about your doom and the danger you&rsquo;re in.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;d love to kiss ________________ before your doom comes.</p>
  <h2>Influence</h2>
  <p>These people matter for what you need to do. Give Influence to two of your teammates.</p>
  <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
  <p>The prickly tingling fear of your doom, always in your head&mdash;it holds you back most of the time. But right here, right now? It gives you the confidence to do anything. After all, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen? Is it worse than your doom? Do impossible things. Do anything. But mark a doomsign after you&rsquo;re finished.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <h2>Doom</h2>
  <p>You&rsquo;re doomed. Your powers may be killing you, or maybe you&rsquo;re hunted ruthlessly, or maybe you embody an apocalypse. But one way or another, your future is grim.What brings your doom closer? Choose two.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>overexerting yourself</li>
  <li>injuring innocents</li>
  <li>facing danger alone</li>
  <li>frightening loved ones</li>
  <li>showing mercy</li>
  <li>talking about it openly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whenever you bring your doom closer, mark one box on your doom track.</p>
  <p>When your doom track fills, clear it and take one of your doomsigns.</p>
  <h2>Doomsigns</h2>
  <p>These are abilities that come to you with your approaching doom. Once you have taken all five doomsigns above the line, you must take &ldquo;Your doom arrives&rdquo; the next time your doom track fills. Choose one doomsign you already hold at character creation.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dark Visions: Mark your doom track to have a vision about the situation at hand. After the vision, ask the GM a question; they will answer it honestly.</li>
  <li>Burning Bright: Mark your doom track to ignore one of the GM&rsquo;s stated requirements when you call upon the resources of your sanctuary.</li>
  <li>Bolstered: Mark your doom track to use an Adult Move one time.</li>
  <li>Infinite Powers: Mark your doom track to use an ability from any playbook, one time.</li>
  <li>Portal: Mark your doom track to appear in a scene with anyone you want.</li>
  <li>Your doom arrives; confront it and perish.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Sanctuary</h2>
  <p>You have a place where you can rest, recover, and reflect upon your powers. Choose and underline three features of your sanctuary:</p>

  <p>Choose and underline two downsides of your sanctuary:</p>
  <p>Difficult to access, draws dangerous attention, location known to many, easily damaged or tampered with, tied intricately to your doom</p>
  <p>When you call upon the resources of your sanctuary to solve a problem, say what you want to do. The GM will give you one to four conditions you must fulfill to complete your solution:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>First, you must _______________________</li>
  <li>You&rsquo;ll need help from ___________________</li>
  <li>You and your team will risk danger from ______</li>

  <h2>PLAYING THE DOOMED</h2>
  <p>Tragic, melodramatic, powerful, driven. The Doomed is a character best served by long-term play, even though their story is about time pressure and not knowing how long they have left. They&rsquo;re the only character who starts with a clear-cut enemy&mdash;their nemesis&mdash;and a dangerous timer on their character&rsquo;s lifespan. They&rsquo;re also the only character that explicitly faces death by the end of their story. As a result, adding a Doomed to your campaign inherently adds a level of drama, gloom, and danger to your game&mdash;death, while not a constant element, is now on the table.</p>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re playing the Doomed, you may feel a desire to avoid using your doomsigns or to stay away from the triggers that advance your doom track. Don&rsquo;t! Embrace those pieces of your character. Filling your doom track gives you doomsigns; doomsigns give you more power; and that power demands a purpose. By default, you can rely on your nemesis to provide you with a purpose, something to strive against, but you can aim for other things, too. Be ready to pay a lot of costs along the way to accomplishing your goals, whether through your sanctuary or other means.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
  <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
  <p>When you pick the two triggers that bring your doom closer, pick actions you&rsquo;re interested in undertaking, not things you&rsquo;re interested in avoiding. The GM will help stay alert for when you bring your doom closer, but you&rsquo;re primarily in charge of watching for the triggers&mdash;so make sure you&rsquo;re invested in them.</p>
  <p>For Infinite Powers, you can use an ability from any playbook&mdash;meaning, one of the abilities listed at the front of each playbook, like acrobatics or telekinesis. This doomsign gives you temporary access to new powers, so you can unleash your powers or directly engage in new ways.</p>
  <p>For Portal, you can appear in a scene with any one other character you name&mdash;whoever else is there is down to the fiction and the GM&rsquo;s choice.</p>
  <p>The last doomsign, &ldquo;Your doom arrives; confront it and perish,&rdquo; triggers the end of your Doomed&rsquo;s story. It means that whatever their doom is at that point finally arrives, and they can&rsquo;t overcome it. They&rsquo;re lost to it. The full end may not happen instantaneously, but it should happen by the end of the session (or</p>
  <p>the next) in which the Doomed marks this final doomsign. Once it&rsquo;s marked, nothing can stop the Doomed from perishing.</p>
  <p>When you <span class="special">call on the resources of your sanctuary to solve a problem</span>, those resources should dictate the conditions the GM imposes on you. Often, you&rsquo;ll have to add some additional resource to your sanctuary to get the job done. If your sanctuary is intricately tied with your doom, then almost always using it to solve a problem should require you to mark your doom track.</p>
  <p>When you take the advance &ldquo;Clear a doomsign,&rdquo; you erase one marked doomsign. That means you have to fill your doom track again to retake it. You lose access to one of your powers, but you delay the arrival of your final doom.</p>
  <p>When you take the advance &ldquo;Confront your doom on your terms; if you survive, change playbooks,&rdquo; it means you&rsquo;re forcing a confrontation with your doom...but you get to define the terms. You might confront your doom and overcome it purely over the course of play&mdash;in which case, the GM might say it&rsquo;s appropriate that you simply mark off this advance and change playbooks. But if you select this advance, you choose to force the issue. You aren&rsquo;t guaranteed to survive that final confrontation&mdash;only to have a chance at victory.</p>

  <h3>SUGGESTED MOVES FROM OTHER PLAYBOOKS</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="special">Alien tech</span>, from the Outsider playbook. Take this if you want your Doomed to have the ability to create artifacts on the fly&mdash;just reinterpret &ldquo;alien tech&rdquo; to match the specifics of your doom and powerset.</li>
  <li><span class="special">Be the monster</span>, from the Transformed playbook. Take this if you want to play up the scary side of your Doomed and how frightening your powers are when they manifest.</li>
  <li><span class="special">Physics? What physics?</span>, from the Bull playbook. Take this if you want to emphasize Danger over Freak when you&rsquo;re using your powers.</li>
  </ul>
