      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Who created you, and why?</li>
        <li>How are you different from humans?</li>
        <li>Who, outside of the team, is your caretaker?</li>
        <li>What about humanity fascinates you the most?</li>
        <li>Why do you care about the team?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you’ve finished your backstory, introduce your character to the other players, and then determine what happened when your team first came together, the relationships between you and your teammates, and who has Influence over you.
      </p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>When our team first came together...</h2>
      <p>The team discovered you during the incident; thanks to them, you reached the outside world and helped in the fight. Where and how did they find you? Who gave you your first nickname?</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <p>________________ is an exemplary human; they show you around and tell you how things work.</p>
      <p>The behavior of ________________ confuses you again and again; you’re determined to understand humanity better by studying them.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Influence</h2>
      <p>You’re receptive to how people think and behave around you. Give Influence to all of your teammates.</p>
      <!-- section -->
      <h2>Moment of Truth</h2>
      <p>Something snaps into focus, and suddenly you’re a full thing, true and complete. You’d never have known how fragmented you were before, if not for here, this moment. You’re not a series of individual lessons. You’re not a series of subroutines and programs. You’re...a person. This must be what it’s like to be...human. And this fullness? It gives you a control over yourself, a unity of purpose you’ve never experienced before. Of course, now that you’re showing off all your potential, it’s only a matter of time before someone comes forward to reduce you to a machine again...</p>

      <h2>A Blank Slate</h2>
      <p>You were created with a basic understanding of the world. When you learn something that helps you make sense of the world, write it down as a lesson. Fill in two lessons when you create your character; fill in the other two when you’ve learned those lessons during play.</p>
      <p>❑ I am ______________________________</p>
      <p>❑ A superhero should ______________________________</p>
      <p>❑ Always ______________________________</p>
      <p>❑ Never ______________________________</p>
      <p>When you embody one of your lessons, shift one Label up and one Label down, your choice. If you cause a misunderstanding, collateral damage, or unintended consequences in the process, mark potential. When you reject one of your lessons, reject its Influence as if it were an NPC. If you choose to have it lose Influence over you, erase that lesson and write a new one in its stead.</p>
      <p>When you approach your creator or caretakers with a problem, tell them what obstacle you face or what you need to achieve, and they will offer you something you need. The GM chooses one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>secret information</li>
        <li>a way to temporarily boost or expand your powers</li>
        <li>access to instruments, weapons, or resources</li>
        <li>official and explicit backing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you accept their help, they rewrite one of your lessons for you.</p>

      <h2>PLAYING THE NEWBORN</h2>
      <p>Curious, strange, quixotic, dogmatic. The Newborn is a kid trying to figure out how the world works, and clinging to principles in an attempt to impose order on their understanding of it. They don’t quite know for sure what their ideals are or should be, but they’re testing them out with every action and idea. The rest of the world has a vested interested in reshaping the Newborn, thanks to all of their potential power. Unlike other <b>Masks</b> PCs, the Newborn can be reshaped not just in terms of Labels, but in terms of hard-coded pieces of morality.</p>
      <p>If you’re playing the Newborn, you are in charge of tracking your lessons. They are critical to your character, but they’re very internally focused. You need to pay attention to them more than any other player in the game. You are in charge of making them matter at every turn. Remind the other players, GM included, about them and how they’re influencing your decisions. Since you’re the final arbiter of how you act with regard to the lessons, you are in charge of calling it out and making the other players notice.</p>
      <p>That said, be prepared for the flip side situation—when other characters take direct interest in what you believe, the lessons you’ve internalized. That leads to brilliant drama, which is exactly what you want, but it’s a natural tendency to resist such influence and manipulation. Don’t—at least not outright. Part of the fun of the Newborn is changing those beliefs in light of others’ attentions, and it only benefits you to go through the process of rejecting an existing belief, experimenting with the new one, causing some damage, and then starting all over.</p>
      <p>That’s an important piece of the Newborn to keep in mind—push your new beliefs to the point where they create fallout and consequences. The Newborn is like a dogmatic philosophy freshman, playing with new forms of morality, pushing them to their extremes...except the Newborn has superpowers, and when they push it to extremes, things get broken. Don’t hesitate to go there.</p>

      <h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For <span class="special">A mind of their own</span>, you gain new abilities, meaning superpowers like telekinesis, elemental control, or whatever else you can come up with.</li>
        <li>For <span class="special">Damage</span>, the new condition Damaged functions like any other condition, adding to the take a powerful blow move, giving you another possible condition to check off before being taken out, and so on. The only way to clear Damaged, however, is through repair. A teammate cannot, for example, comfort or support you and help you clear the Damaged condition...unless that comfort or support is explicitly helping you to repair yourself.</li>
        <li>For <span class="special">Blank slate</span>, the GM is the final arbiter of whether or not you embody one of your lessons. Never shift Labels for embodying a lesson without calling it out and making sure the GM agrees. The GM is also the final arbiter of whether or not you cause misunderstanding, collateral damage, or unintended consequences when embodying your lesson. You can always choose to reject one of your lessons at any time, but you must do something to actually trigger the move, the same as the regular reject Influence move.</li>
        <li>For <span class="special">Regeneration</span>, being taken out explicitly means needing to mark a condition and being unable to do so because they are all already marked. If you take this move, you should try to rack up those conditions—don’t always get rid of them. Otherwise you will never get to play with the move!</li>
      </ul>
