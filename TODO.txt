- add auto-advances for potential on a failed roll.
- add influence to rolling (when you click any move roll button, instead of immediately rolling, it can pop up a dialog w/ a list of all the influences you have in your character sheet + a check box next to each one. For each checkbox you check, you get a +1 on the roll. (or maybe it's radio buttons? not sure if multiple influences can affect the same roll)
