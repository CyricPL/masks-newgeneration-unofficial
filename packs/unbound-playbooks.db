They&rsquo;re not bopping around, and are in fact stuck in this time period. Only their memories will let them get some insight on what is coming. For that reason, &ldquo;Connecting the dots&rdquo; is crucial for the Harbinger. You need to fill in a few names in that area of your playbook to have some people to investigate, so go for it immediately, even though you&rsquo;re rolling at a -1. If you find an NPC you think is interesting, then connect the dots on them!</p>\n<p>Your primary tension is that of the young person driven to make the world better, but not entirely sure how to do it. Most of the other PCs want to do good and make the world better, but they either take situations as they happen, or they have guidance from an external force.

The Scion is the child of a real supervillain, but they won&rsquo;t let that define them. They&rsquo;re determined to prove they are their own person by being a greater hero than their parent is a villain, even as the rest of the world paints them with the same brush as their progenitor.</p>\n<p>The Scion is heavily defined in relationship to another character&mdash;but that relationship is not direct the way it is for the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; or the Legacy. The Scion may interact with their villainous parent very rarely during the course of play, but their parent will always cast a dire shadow upon all that they do. Other characters aware of the relationship between the Scion and their parent will always see the Scion in that light, until the Scion successfully &ldquo;earns&rdquo; the right to be viewed independently. As a result, when the Scion designs their parent, they are designing an important character for the game as a whole&mdash;but they are not necessarily designing another member of the main cast.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Scion focuses on particular other characters with their Respect extra. Any name filled into the Respect area of their playbook is immediately flagged as a crucial character to the game as a whole, someone the Scion is interested in interacting with further. When playing the Scion, you should use this extra to aim yourself at the characters and relationships you are most interested in pursuing&mdash;if you name a character here that you don&rsquo;t actually care that much about as a player, you&rsquo;re going to be in trouble.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">For Changed sides, you define who is an enemy, but keep in mind that an &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; is real opposition&mdash;not simply someone who is currently in your way, but someone you see as truly opposed to you. The same goes for They don&rsquo;t deserve forgiveness. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Also for Changed sides, someone watching (like a teammate) may still doubt your loyalties even on a 10+...but on a miss, they have no questions. They come to the worst possible conclusion, and act immediately. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">For All the best stuff, when you define whose cache it is, you should feel free to create a new NPC&mdash;but try to use existing characters, especially to bolster ongoing relationships. The GM is the final arbiter of whether a given character is a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; or a &ldquo;villain&rdquo;&mdash;the judgment is not about perception, but the kind of things they would keep in their cache. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">For Respect, name characters you are interested in spending more time with&mdash; especially seeing as you will be trying to earn Influence over those characters. Most of the time that you earn Influence over a given character, you do it through the fiction itself, especially by piercing their mask and fulfilling the condition for &ldquo;How could I gain Influence over you?&rdquo; That means you&rsquo;re going to want to spend a lot of time with the characters in your Respect section, seeking them out and trying to impress them.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Naming a character for Respect means you cannot hold standard Influence over them; all of those rules no longer apply with regards to you gaining Influence over them.

The Nomad has seen things that their peers can&rsquo;t even imagine. They&rsquo;ve seen the universe at play. They&rsquo;ve encountered other cultures and ideas, and they have their own collection of cool toys. And for all that awesomeness, the Nomad has never had their own home or family. Their story is all about connecting deeply to the people and world around them, instead of bouncing off to something new and different.</p>\n<p>The two crucial questions for the Nomad during character creation are &ldquo;What brought you back to stay (for now)?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why do you care about the team?&rdquo; The Nomad only works because they have chosen to remain with the team&mdash;if they followed their wanderlust, they wouldn&rsquo;t be part of a MASKS game.</p>\n<p>Make sure that between these two questions, your Nomad has clear, durable reasons to stick with the team. &ldquo;I came back to stay because I need to get a flux capacitor to repay my debt to the Pirate Queen of Orion&rdquo; is a cool answer, but not a durable answer&mdash;as soon as the Nomad gets the flux capacitor, they can go back to space. &ldquo;I came back to stay because I&rsquo;m wanted across space for a crime I didn&rsquo;t commit&rdquo; is better&mdash;as long as you remain wanted, you&rsquo;re stuck on Earth, and there&rsquo;s no clear path to having that status changed.</p>\n<p>Finally, your extra, Putting down roots, has you uniquely playing with Influence. You are incentivized to give out Influence, for all the benefits you get&mdash;but remember, you can only give out Influence to six characters total, including teammates. Some of the benefits are much more advantageous when you give Influence to an enemy than when you give it to an ally, too. And while you can take back Influence at the end of every session, it&rsquo;s otherwise pretty hard to shift it around once you&rsquo;ve given it out. Balancing the tension between wanting to give out your Influence and picking exactly the right people to give it to is at the heart of the whole playbook&mdash;so have fun with it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Out of this world, what it means to plug into the cosmic aether is up to you. Maybe you listen to some weird music you picked up out in space; maybe you burn some transdimensional incense and meditate. Whatever you choose, it should be consistent&mdash;it shouldn&rsquo;t shift every time you do it.</p>\n<p>For Putting down roots, all rules not called out as different here function as normal. For example, those you give Influence to can still shift your Labels, and you can still reject their Influence. Your benefits are based on how many other characters have Influence over you&mdash;meaning that if you take Influence over you away from other characters, you may lose some of those benefits.</p>\n<p>Note that you do not have an advancement to retire or become a paragon; instead, you depart for reaches unknown, never to return.
