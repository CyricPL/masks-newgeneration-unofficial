# Masks: A New Generation (Unofficial) Revised

This module contains moves for the game Masks: A New Generation for use with the Foundry VTT generic PbtA System (https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta). You can install this system with this link: https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta/-/jobs/artifacts/beta/raw/system.json?job=build-beta

The content from this module is from **Masks: A New Generation** from **Magpie Games**. You can get the PDF at: https://magpiegames.com/masks/

This revised version of the module is based on the original created by brunocalado (https://github.com/brunocalado/masks-newgeneration-unofficial). In the update, the text of the moves has been slightly rearranged and every move has a custom icon from game-icons.net (https://game-icons.net/).

In addition, Compendium Folders (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earlSt1/vtt-compendium-folders/master/module.json) is a dependency for this version. If you do not already have Compendium Folders installed, you should be prompted to install it when installing this module.
